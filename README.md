# Plastic-Detection-Using-yolov5
Our project aims to develop a reliable and efficient AI-based model using drone images to detect plastic waste in rivers and other bodies of water. By leveraging the power of deep learning and computer vision techniques, our solution addresses the urgent need to reduce the negative impact of plastic pollution on the environment and human health.
